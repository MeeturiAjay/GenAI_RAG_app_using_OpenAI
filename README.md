🌟 GenAI RAG App using OpenAI & Web Scraping

Welcome to the GenAI RAG App! 🚀 This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using OpenAI's GPT models and web scraping techniques to fetch and process real-time data. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will walk you through the entire setup and functionality.

📌 What is this project about?

This app enhances the capabilities of Generative AI by integrating real-time web data into responses. Traditional AI models rely on pre-trained knowledge, but RAG improves accuracy by fetching latest information from the web before generating responses.

✔ Retrieval: Scrapes relevant data from websites 📡\n
✔ Augmented Generation: Uses OpenAI's GPT to process and generate responses ✨

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time Web Scraping – Fetches the latest information from web pages 📊
✅ GPT-Powered Responses – Combines retrieved data with AI-generated insights 🤖
✅ Fast & Efficient – Processes requests quickly using optimized web scraping 🔥

🏗️ Tech Stack Used
🧠 OpenAI GPT – Generates human-like responses
🌐 Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup) – Extracts useful information from the web
🐍 Python – Core backend logic

🎯 How to Set Up and Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/MeeturiAjay/GenAI_RAG_app_using_OpenAI.git
cd GenAI_RAG_app_using_OpenAI

5️⃣ Run the Application
If using Streamlit:
 streamlit run app.py
 

🎉 Now, open your browser and start exploring AI-powered responses!

🔥 Example Usage
💡 User Input:📝 "Tell me the latest news about AI advancements."

⚙️ What happens in the backend?
The app scrapes recent AI news from trusted websites. 🕵️
It processes the retrieved text using OpenAI's GPT. 🧠
The AI generates an insightful, up-to-date response. ✨

📜 Final Response:"According to the latest reports from TechCrunch and MIT News, AI research has made significant progress in explainability and multimodal learning..."
