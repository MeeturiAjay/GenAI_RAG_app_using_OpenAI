# 🌟 GenAI RAG App using OpenAI & Web Scraping

Welcome to the **GenAI RAG App**! 🚀 This project demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application using **OpenAI's GPT models** and **web scraping techniques** to fetch and process real-time data. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will walk you through the entire setup and functionality.

## 📌 What is this project about?

This app enhances the capabilities of **Generative AI** by integrating **real-time web data** into responses. Traditional AI models rely on pre-trained knowledge, but **RAG improves accuracy** by fetching the latest information from the web before generating responses.

## 🔍 Retrieval & Generation  

✅ **Retrieval:** Scrapes relevant data from websites 🕊️  
✅ **Augmented Generation:** Uses OpenAI's GPT to process and generate responses ✨
